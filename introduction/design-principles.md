# Design Principles

## :zap: Self-Sovereign Identity

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) empowers users by granting complete control over their data, including digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC). By decentralizing identity management, there is enhanced privacy and security. In the context of Tyron, the SSI Protocol principles encompass:

- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

- Social Recovery

- Account Abstraction

## :bank: Bitcoin

Bitcoin stands out as the most secure network, being a decentralized, permissionless, and tamper-resistant platform primarily due to its innovative use of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism:

1. Mining: Bitcoin transactions are grouped into blocks, and miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to add a block to the blockchain.

2. Consensus: The first miner to solve the puzzle broadcasts the solution, and other nodes verify its validity. Consensus is reached when the majority of nodes agree on the validity of the new block.

3. Security: PoW ensures security by making it computationally expensive to modify past blocks. Any attempt to alter a block would require redoing the work for that block and all subsequent blocks, making it economically unfeasible.

### :bison: BTC's ZK-Rollup

The ZK-rollup by [Bison Labs](https://bisonlabs.io) plays a pivotal role in enhancing Bitcoin's scalability. This technology will significantly boost the network's transaction processing capacity without compromising its security or decentralization by grouping multiple transactions into a single proof. To then validate the correctness of such a proof by submitting it to the main Bitcoin blockchain.

Therefore, ZK-rollups enable faster and more cost-effective transactions, optimizing specific functionalities and use cases such as stablecoins, effectively addressing the Bitcoin network's throughput and scalability challenges.

Crucially, the fundamental technique behind ZK-rollups ensures scalability without sacrificing security, making them an indispensable solution for the future of cryptocurrencies. In addressing Bitcoin's scalability hurdles, ZK-rollups emerge as a vital component, ensuring the network's growth while upholding security standards.
