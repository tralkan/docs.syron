# Minters

The Syron U$D's stablecoin is generated by minter SSI accounts (MISAs) identified as smart contracts with the special `MINTER_ROLE` granted by the Access Control system.

This allows for tailored U$D minting functionality per MISA.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** MISAs, being minter SSI accounts, may operate without an SSI controller, governed solely by the code. However, an admin role as an SSI controller can be beneficial in certain scenarios for administering context parameters.

## SSI Vaults

The smart contract housing the code of a MISA maintains a registry of SSI Vaults. These vaults autonomously track user balances in a permissionless manner.

```
uint256 private _vaultSupply;
mapping(address account => uint256) private _vaults;
```

## Oracles

For most MISAs, a reliable source of truth is essential, typically obtained from off-chain data and accessed through oracles.

Information can also originate from on-chain data, such as Decentralized Exchanges and DeFi applications. In this scenario, MISAs can read the required data at the time of the transaction in an atomic manner.
