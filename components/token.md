# Token

The Syron U$D stablecoin is crafted as a digital token that can be seamlessly sent over a bridge connecting the Bitcoin network and a ZK-rollup.

**What is a fungible token?**

A fungible token is interchangeable with others of the same type and value. This means each unit is identical and can be traded on a one-to-one basis. Fungible tokens are divisible and lack uniqueness, making them uniform and easily exchangeable, just like money.
{% endhint %}

The fungible token smart contract is a vital component of Syron's core infrastructure, residing on the ZK-Rollup to establish smooth connectivity with the broader stablecoin dApp.
